## Inheritance
Inheritance is a core concept of OOP. It is a mechanisim that allows you to create a heirachy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive the properties from another class.

**Benefits of inheritance:**
1. represents real-world relationships well
2. Allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it
3. Makes code more reusable
4. It is transitive in nature, ie. If B inherits from A, any class that inherits from B also inherits from A
5. It is a simple and understandable model structure
6. Easier to develop and maintain
