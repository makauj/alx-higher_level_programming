# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
 1. What are lists and how to use them
 2. What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
 3. What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
 4. How to use lists as stacks and queues
 5. What are list comprehensions and how to use them
 6. What are tuples and how to use them
 7. When to use tuples versus lists
 8. What is a sequence
 9. What is tuple packing
 10. What is sequence unpacking
 11. What is the del statement and how to use it

## Tasks
 0. Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
 1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
 2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
 3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
 4. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
 5. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
 6. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
 7. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
 8. Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
 9. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
 10. Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
 11. Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
 12. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b.
python3```
#!/usr/bin/python3
a = 89
b = 10
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE. PLEASE REMOVE THIS LINE
print(a={:d} - b={:d}".format(a, b))
```
 13. Technical interview preparation:
	- Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
 14. Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
