#0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
In this repo, I will be doing tasks that will help me understand if/else statements, loops and functions in Python.
There will also be a technical interview prep task where I'll come up with a function that 
inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. Thus task will be completed in C.
